## Cutting-Edge Technical Aspects

This project incorporates several cutting-edge technologies and approaches:

*   **Web Container:** The demos are hosted using a Web Container, providing a consistent and isolated environment for running the examples.
*   **React Web Container Integration:** Seamless integration of the Web Container within a React application.
*   **TanStack Start:** Utilizes TanStack Start for enhanced project setup and development experience.
*   **Bun:** Employs Bun as the project's package manager and runtime, leveraging its speed and efficiency.
*   **Vitest and React Testing Library in a Web Container:** Integration of Vitest with React Testing Library to run tests directly within the web container.
*   **Monaco Editor:** Integration of the Monaco Editor for in-browser code editing, enabling real-time modifications and testing.
*   **Xterm:** Integration of Xterm for in-browser terminal, enabling interaction with the web container.

## Future Enhancements

*   Expand testing examples to cover more complex scenarios.
*   A tool to select a test from the demo suite.
*   Use the router as a source of state (e.g. selected test).
*   Improve the UI/UX of the project.
*   Improve documentation and examples.
